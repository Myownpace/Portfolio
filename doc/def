Why do i want a portfolio?
    I want potential clients to see my portfolio and go "whoaaaaaaa, who is this guy, i need him now"

So how do you think your portfolio should look like to make that happen
    to answer this, let's do a little analysis
        Q: What would make a client want you for a job
        A: If they believe that you can get the job done

        Q: So how can you make them believe that you can get the job done from your portfolio
        A: 1. My portfolio should be an amazing website => To let them know how good at my job i am
           2. The navigation through my portfolio should be effortless
           3. Your portfolio should introduce you well enough (preferably as a good person ), so that they feel like they know and trust you
           4. Just one good website isn 't enough so your portfolio should also include amazing projects you have worked on
    so from the analysis here is a fairly detailed blue print of my portfolio
        1. Skills you wish to offer
        2. Personal information like your name, home land, residential address, school you attend, contact info, upwork account, whatsapp
        3. Work ethics and philosophy of work
        4. collection of websites you have worked on with each collection including a gallery of images of the website with optional captions, a description of the website[start and end date] as well as an optional link to the website
        5. an option for selecting how the view of the collections should be
            * list view
            * grid view
            * slide show view
        6. when a website is viewed
            * list view
            * grid view
            * slide show view
